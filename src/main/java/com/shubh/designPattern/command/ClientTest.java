/*
    It is a way of making requests when we don't know anything about what's exactly is being requested or what's exactly its receiving it.
    1. Encapsulates a request inside an object
    2. Decouples the object that invokes the command from the object that knows how to handle it

    Use cases:
    1. Supporting undo/redo operations
    2. Queueing and logging requests to be performed at different times
